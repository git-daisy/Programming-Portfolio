# Programming-Portfolio Page
A project to showcase my developing skills as they progress at Epicodus, this is simply a page talking about myself.
 
#### Creator : Daisy Collins

## Technologies Used :
* HTML
* CSS
* Github

## Description : 
  This project was a much needed refresher on the basics of HTML and CSS. Even though these arent really considered "languages", I experienced my fair share of struggling to figure out tricks like resizing, placement of elements/images/boxes 
and calculating pixels (still suck at it). I am really happy with the layout and feel that I have a good understanding of each of the technologies used, I would just like to work on understanding the box model and how I can get everything lined up perfectly.
